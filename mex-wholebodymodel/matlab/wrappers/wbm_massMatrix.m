function M = wbm_massMatrix(varargin)
    % WBM_MASSMATRIX computes the generalized mass matrix of the floating-base robot w.r.t. the
    % given joint configuration q_j.
    %
    % Input Arguments:
    %
    %   Normal mode:
    %       wf_R_b -- (3 x 3) rotation matrix from the base frame 'b' to the world frame 'wf'.
    %       wf_p_b -- (3 x 1) position vector from the base frame 'b' to the world frame 'wf'.
    %       q_j    -- (n_dof x 1) joint angle vector in [rad].
    %
    %   Optimized mode:  No arguments.
    %
    % Output Arguments:
    %   M -- (n_dof+6 x n_dof+6) generalized mass matrix of the robot.
