function wbm_setWorldFrame(varargin)
    % WBM_SETWORLDFRAME sets the world frame (wf) at a given position and orientation relative from
    % a specified fixed link frame (base reference frame).
    %
    % The base reference frame, also called floating-base frame, is attached to the fixed base
    % reference link of the robot. The specified fixed link (base reference link) of the robot
    % can also be a contact constraint link.
    %
    % Note:
    %   The internally specified base-to-world transformation matrix wf_H_b of the yarpWBM
    %   supports (w.r.t. a given joint configuration q_j) the optimized computations of all kinematic
    %   and dynamic functions of the given C++ component classes. Moreover, it supports also the
    %   computation of the base VQ-transformation vqT_b of the current model's state.
    %
    % Input Arguments:
    %   wf_R_b -- (3 x 3) rotation matrix from the base frame 'b' to the world frame 'wf'.
    %   wf_p_b -- (3 x 1) position vector from the base frame 'b' to the world frame 'wf'.
    %   g_wf   -- (3 x 1) gravity vector in the world frame 'wf'.
