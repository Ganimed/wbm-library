function c_qv = wbm_coriolisBiasForces(varargin)
    % WBM_CORIOLISBIASFORCES computes the bias Coriolis and centrifugal forces C(q_j,dq_j) in the
    % dynamics of rigid-body systems.
    %
    % Note:
    %   This function is derived from the generalized bias force function and depends
    %   on the same state parameter triplet [q_j, dq_j, v_b] as the parent-function.
    %
    % Input Arguments:
    %
    %   Normal mode:
    %       wf_R_b -- (3 x 3) rotation matrix from the base frame 'b' to the world frame 'wf'.
    %       wf_p_b -- (3 x 1) position vector from the base frame 'b' to the world frame 'wf'.
    %       q_j    -- (n_dof x 1) joint angle vector in [rad].
    %       dq_j   -- (n_dof x 1) joint angle velocity vector in [rad/s].
    %       v_b    -- (6 x 1) generalized base velocity vector.
    %
    %   Optimized mode:  No arguments.
    %
    % Output Arguments:
    %   c_qv -- (n_dof+6 x 1) bias Coriolis and centrifugal force vector of the robot.
