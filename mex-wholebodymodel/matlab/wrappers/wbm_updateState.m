function wbm_updateState(varargin)
    % WBM_UPDATESTATE updates the state of the robot model, i.e. the joint angles,
    % joint velocities and the generalized base velocity of the floating base.
    %
    % Input Arguments:
    %   q_j  -- (n_dof x 1) joint angle vector in [rad].
    %   dq_j -- (n_dof x 1) joint angle velocity vector in [rad/s].
    %   v_b  -- (6 x 1) generalized base velocity vector.
